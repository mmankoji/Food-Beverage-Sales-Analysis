# Food-Beverage-Sales-Analysis
Food and Beverage Sales Analysis Dashboard
* Built an interactive dashboard to visualize sales opportunities of F&B manufacturer services in three different business segments.
* Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheets and customization using filters and slicers.
* Created connections, join new columns, and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations.
* Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, slicers, tables, etc).
